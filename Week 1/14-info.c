// In traditional days there used to be two bits because for more it was expensive. So the year used to count like - 1999 -> 00, 01, 02, 50, 87, 99 so people used to get confuse for the year 2000 because it used to show 00

// Nowadays we use 32bits in the computer which display the clock like 19 January 1970. The people set the beiggining time as this date and when the year gets 19 January 1938 the 32 bit will be finished and round back to 13 December 1901 or 0 or negative value

// In Pacman game there 256 levels after 256 it screen gets different or to 1st level because it uses 8 bits that is 256 integers

// Similary in Monkey kong game  they used this formula for timing to complete the level 10*(level+4) but when we reach 22 level it will get 260 which makes 260 - 256 = 4 then the level has to be completed in 4 seconds
