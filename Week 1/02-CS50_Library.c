// In C lot of the functionality that comes along with the language is held in separate files
// so if we want to use that functions then we have to tell the compiler like i want standard input output functions so we use #include <stdio.h> to use the function printf(). the code of the printf is inside header file and will just copy from that header file from our local disk to the our actual c file.

// .h - header file - libraries (it is the code that someone else wrote also free and open source usually)

// Manual pages:
// these are documentation to learn more 
// manual.cs50.io

// cs50.h 
// which has the functions that is written by cs50 teams
// get_char
// get_string
// get_int
// get_float
// get_double
// get_long
