// Making a decision in a program

// if(x<y){
//     printf("x is less than y\n");
// }

// where if is the conditional and x<y is the conditions or boolean expression which is 0 or 1, yes or no, true or false, then inside the curly braces there is the block of code which is to be printed or executed when it is true
// if only one line code then curly braces can be skipped - it all depends on us while writting the code

// if(x<y){
//     printf("x is less than y\n");
// }
// else{
//     printf("y is less than x\n");
// }

// else is executed if the if condition is not met

// if(x<y){
//     printf("x is less than y\n");
// }
// else if(x==y){
//     printf("x is equal to y\n");
// }
// else if(y<x){
//     printf("y is less than x\n");
// }

// else if - it is for more conditions or boolean expressions

// if(x<y){
//     printf("x is less than y\n");
// }
// else if(x==y){
//     printf("x is equal to y\n");
// }
// else{
//     printf("y is less than x\n");
// }

// else can also be used instead of using one more else if and its condition


// why we use == ?
// because it can be get confused with = , that is used in the variables as assignment operator 
// assigning is always from right to left
// == is used as the equality check
