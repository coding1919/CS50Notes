// Linux is a very popular operating system
// When we first turns on the computer it gets boots up
// It is commonly used for servers
// It is particularly characterized by its textual interface - command line interface (CLI) also it is in graphical user interface (GUI) too

// when we go to cs50.dev we are just accesing VS code in the cloud. Which means The software is running in the browser, but it is connected to the server in the cloud which is a docker container - that is like we have our own mini server in the cloud which i means the system who are using only has the access
// That server or the container is running an OS called Linux
// That means when everytime which we use code and terminal that directly connects to the server in the cloud that is my own Linux container or server

// Linux allows different types of commands 
// cd - we can go inside or outside of the folder 
// cp - copy
// ls - lists the file in the current folder
// mkdir - make directory
// mv - mv original_file_name new_file_name 
// mv hello.c woof.c // it will change the name of the file
// rm - will remove the file - rm hello.c - then press y
// rmdir - remove directory
