// Sorting is like order which we arrange the element is ascending order that is from small to large or any other order which we desire to have

// In first method David visited all the elements and if the element was smaller from 0 index to 7 index then it would swap with 0 index like if 0 was in 5th index and 6 was in 0th index then 0 will swap to 0 index and 5 will swap to 6 index and so on the process repeats......

// second method was locally checking both - that is if 0 index had 5 and 1 index had 3 then they would swap each other now 3 will be at 0 index and 5 at 1 index - and if 0 index had 3 and 1 index had 5 then they would not swap each other
