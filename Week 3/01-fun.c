// Student counting method

// 1. By counting each of them one by one
// 2. By counting in the form of two - 2,4,6,8,10.........
// 3. 
// Stand up and think of the number 1.
// Pair off with someone standing, add their number to yours, and remember the sum.
// One of you should then sit down.
// If still standing, go back to step 2.

// we have known that in graph
// n
// n/2
// log2n

// In phonebook or contacts
// when we search a user
// it uses halving method which is logaritm

// if we want to find david if we have letter d then first among 100 contacts it divides to 50 and then again 50 and we consider 1st 50 and in that we again divide it will be 25 and we consider 1st 25 and in that we will divide again that is 12 and 13 lets say again we consider 1st 12 and we divide again into that is 6 and we consider 1st 6 and again we divide that is 3 and  now we consider 2nd 3 again we divide 3 that is 1 and 2 aand we choose 1 that 1 is D letter 
// This is beacause d is the 4th letter

// this step is done for almost 6 to 8 times and we achieve the desire result so this is a efficient way
